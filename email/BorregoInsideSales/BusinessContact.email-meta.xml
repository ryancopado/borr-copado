Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your interest in Borrego Solar.  We would love to come out and do a free solar site evaluation for your home.  Before our Energy Consultant comes out, however, we like to do a pre-solar evaluation phone call. This will help us determine who the best consultant for your project is, and what resources they should bring out. This is very important so we can do a thorough and accurate evaluation. Please let me know when and where to call you, or you can reach me at {!User.Phone} Monday-Friday 9am-5:30pm. Thank you for considering Borrego Solar. 

Sincerely,

{!User.Name}
