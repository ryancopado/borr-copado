    <subject>Solar at {!Account.Name} - 5 year payback and 20% IRR</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I am writing to see if {!Account.Name} has considered solar. I know many of your peers in California have considered it in the past, but costs have dropped by almost 25% over the last year, and we&apos;re seeing that projects that didn&apos;t pencil as recently as 2011 are penciling now. Furthermore, California&apos;s rebate program is drying up, so this is a perfect time to run some numbers to see if solar works for your facility.

I work with Borrego Solar, a California-based company that provides commercial solar systems to California agricultural customers. I work with many food processors in the Valley, and I am typically seeing very good returns with systems generating roughly 5-year paybacks and greater than 20% IRRs.  

For more than 30 years, Borrego Solar has been working to help customers go solar and we&apos;ve built more than 55 MW to date. Some of our recent CA customers include: 

- Madera Community Hospital
- City of Ridgecrest
- Padre Dam Municipal Water District
- Helix Water District
- Zone 7 Water District
- Vista Irrigation District

If you or your facility have thought about solar, please do one of the following:
- Send me a quick e mail. I will follow up with a call at your convenience;
- Call me directly on my mobile at 415-378-5885; or,
- Forward this to a colleague or staff member who has been thinking about this issue. 

In five minutes, I can tell you more about our program and see if there might be an economic advantage to your going solar.

{!Contact.FirstName}, thanks for your time.  Borrego Solar has been working with customers like you for more than 30 years, and I hope we&apos;ll have the opportunity to talk soon.

Best regards,

Steve Birndorf
