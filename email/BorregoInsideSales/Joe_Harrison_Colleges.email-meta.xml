    <subject>Save Money at {!Lead.Company} with Solar Power</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName} {!Lead.LastName}, 
 
Since I mailed you our school’s video last month I’ve been swamped helping several environmentally-conscious private schools finance solar power installations for no money down.  
 
Now that I’ve come up for air, I want to make sure «Institution» has explored these same opportunities.  
 
With no capital outlay, {!Lead.Company} will be able to save money on day one, lock-in low energy rates, accurately forecast 20 years of operation budgets, and reduce its carbon footprint.
 
With a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), we will cover the cost to design, install, operate and maintain , {!Lead.Company}’s solar electric system with no up-front cost. You simply purchase clean renewable solar power at a discounted rate to what you’re currently paying for electricity.  There are no risks, because we pay all of the operations and maintenance costs.   
 
For 30 years, Borrego Solar has been working to help schools go solar, and since last 2009, we secured nearly $100 million to finance solar projects for educational institutions. 
 
Here’s a partial list of recent customers:
 





University of CA San Diego


San Diego Community College District



College of Marin


New Haven Unified School District



Lagunitas School District


Massachusetts Institute of Technology
