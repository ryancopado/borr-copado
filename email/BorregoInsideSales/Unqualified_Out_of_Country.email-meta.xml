    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName}, 

Thank you for your interest in Borrego Solar. Unfortunately we currently only offer
our services to areas within the United States.  We also only sell solar
system components to customers we install systems for.  To find a solar
company by country please refer to this website: http://www.enf.cn/
 
Good luck and thanks for your
commitment to creating a clean energy future. Have a great day! 

Sincerely,
