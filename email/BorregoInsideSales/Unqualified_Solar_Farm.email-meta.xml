    <subject>Borrego Solar: Thank you for your inquiry</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName}, 

Thank you for your interest in
Borrego Solar. Regarding your inquiry about a solar farm, these installations
are often not feasible unless directly initiated by the Utility. 
Currently, Utilities will not pay you for excess electricity produced and only
allow solar installations to cover on-site electrical consumption (i.e. the
electricity used by appliances on site and tracked on a utility meter). 
This means that there is no incentive to overproduce, making solar farm
projects a tough sell.

 

The only way to have a solar farm
succeed is with sponsorship for the Utility, becoming a small generation plant
that the Utility draws from while paying you for the power produced. 
These opportunities do exist but are limited in scope.
Hopefully that gives some clarity to the situation. If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me. Have a great day!


Sincerely,

{!Lead.OwnerFullName}
