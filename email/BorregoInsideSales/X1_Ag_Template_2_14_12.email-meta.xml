    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I am writing to see if {!Account.Name} has considered going solar? It&apos;s a great investment with attractive and stable economic returns, and there’s a lot of positive PR that comes with a solar facility.

I work for Borrego Solar, a California based company that finances and builds commercial solar systems for California agricultural customers. We capitalize, design, install, operate and maintain the solar system at your facility with no up-front cost and no financial risk. You simply purchase clean, renewable solar power from us at a discount to what you currently pay for electricity.  If a purchase or lease is more appealing, we do that as well. With most California food processing customers, we are seeing a 15-20% IRR with 4-6 year paybacks.

For 30 years, Borrego Solar has been working to help customers go solar and we&apos;ve built more than 46MW to date.  Some of our recent CA customers include:

+ San Diego County Water Authority
+ Padre Dam Municipal Water District
+ City of Ridgecrest
+ Madera Community Hospital
+ Santa Clara County
+ Zone 7 Water District
+ Vista Irrigation District

If you’ve thought about solar, or you are interested in learning more, please do one of the following:

1) Hit reply and send me a brief note.  I will follow up with a call at your convenience;
2) Call me directly on my mobile at 415-378-5885; or,
3) Forward this to a colleague or staff member who has been thinking about this issue.

In five minutes, I can tell you more about our program and see if there might be an economic advantage to your going solar.
{!Contact.FirstName}, thanks for your time.  Borrego Solar has been working with customers like you for more than 30 years, and I hope we&apos;ll have the opportunity to get together soon.
Best regards,

Steve Birndorf
