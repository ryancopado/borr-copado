    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to let you know that we&apos;ve made some updates to our customer portal to give you more insight into how well your system is operating.
- You can now log in to the portal from www.borregosolar.com - just click on &apos;Customer Login&apos; in the top right corner
- Within the Performance Reporting link we&apos;ve added simple reporting capabilities so you can print out historical production information. Just choose the view you&apos;d like to see across the top, choose a start date on the calendar at the bottom and click the arrow  to the right to download an Excel document.
- We&apos;ve expanded details regarding Cases and Service Visits, so you&apos;ll be able to see real-time updates if your system undergoes repair and will know when to expect us on site for our next Service Visit.

I noticed that the last login for the portal was in XX/XX. If you&apos;ve forgotten your username or password, let me know and I can reset it. As always, if there&apos;s more value that you feel the portal could provide, please let me know.

Other than that, how have things been? Have you had any problems with the system or do you have any lingering questions? It&apos;d be great to chat briefly next week - if there&apos;s a day and time that works best for you, let me know and I&apos;ll do my best to accommodate.

I look forward to speaking with you soon,
Tommy
