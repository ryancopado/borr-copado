    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I&apos;m Tommy Sunderland, the Customer Experience Manager for Borrego Solar - I work closely with PROJECT DEVELOPER and PROJECT MANAGER. As the customer advocate for the company I always check in a few months after each system has been commissioned to see how things went, solicit feedback and ensure that any loose ends have been wrapped up. I noticed the installation for PROJECT NAME went live on PTO DATE and wanted to set up a time to discuss by phone the items below as well as any other thoughts/comments you may have:
- Did the project go as planned and are you happy with the result?
- Did you receive closeout documentation, including electrical drawings, warranty information and safety manuals?
- Have you been introduced to the data monitoring system that allows you to track system production online?
- Do you have any other questions? Or is there anything else you&apos;d like me to know?

Additionally, we offer a free customer portal that includes detailed system information, electronic versions of your closeout documents, a link to real-time production monitoring and a case management system that allows you submit and track cases online anytime day or night. If this is something you&apos;d be interested in, let me know and I can get you set up on the portal.

I&apos;ll follow up on these items with a call next week - if there&apos;s a day and time that works best for you, let me know and I&apos;ll do my best to accommodate.

I look forward to speaking with you soon,
Tommy
