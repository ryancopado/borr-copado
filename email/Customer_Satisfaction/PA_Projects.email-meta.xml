    <subject>Visit from Borrego Solar the first week of August</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope this email finds you well. As Borrego Solar&apos;s new Customer Experience Manager, I wanted reach out and check in on how things have been at {!Account.Name}. It&apos;s been quite a while since your solar electric system received Permission to Operate on INSERT PTO DATE HERE and I wanted to see how the system has been performing.

I will actually be travelling through Pennsylvania the first week of August and was wondering if you&apos;d be available for a site visit at that time. I&apos;m hoping to stop by, introduce myself, tour the installation and also offer you a token of our appreciation for your business. Would you be free on INSERT TIME AND DATE for us to meet? Please let me know.

Again, on behalf of Borrego Solar I&apos;d like to thank you for your business and your commitment to clean energy. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Cheers,
Tommy Sunderland
