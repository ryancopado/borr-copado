    <subject>Followup regarding my site visit on 8/6/2013</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks for meeting with me two weeks ago. I&apos;ve included some notes and pictures from my findings on site as well as an electronic copy of the production report and letter that I handed over during the visit. I&apos;ve also included a quote for cleaning services toward the end of this email if you still have interest.

Notes from Site Visit:
-

Cleaning Services:
- We can arrange to have the system cleaned by our preferred module washer on the East Coast for $X,XXX. If you&apos;re interested in a full O&amp;M plan that includes active system monitoring, an annual site inspection and cleaning, we can also price out a package for that. Please &apos;reply all&apos; to this email and Matt Murphy (cc-ed here) can orchestrate either option.

If you&apos;re interested in cleaning services or a more robust O&amp;M package please respond to me and Matt Murphy (O&amp;M Manager, cc-ed on this email) and we can draft up a formal contract.

I hope you were able to find a nice place to hang the picture. Thanks again for your time and for choosing Borrego Solar - we sincerely appreciate your business.

Cheers,
Tommy Sunderland

P.S. I &apos;liked&apos; your company on Facebook and was able to tag the company in a post from my site visit - another nice picture of the installation. Feel free to share the post on your wall if you&apos;d like.
