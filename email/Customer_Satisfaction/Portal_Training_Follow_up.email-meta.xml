    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks for attending the portal training today. You can log in to the portal from www.borregosolar.com - just click on &apos;Customer Login&apos; in the top right corner. I would recommend using Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome browsers, as Internet Explorer can encounter problems. If you do use Internet Explorer, make sure it&apos;s the latest version.

Some quick tips:
- Within the Performance Reporting link we&apos;ve added simple reporting capabilities so you can print out historical production information. Just choose the view you&apos;d like to see across the top (e.g. &apos;Month&apos;), choose a start date on the calendar at the bottom (e.g. &apos;5/1/2014&apos;) and click the arrow  to the right to download an Excel document.
- Use Contact Us to submit questions or notify us of a problem with the system. Just fill out the appropriate fields and click &apos;Submit Inquiry&apos; at the bottom - it will alert multiple parties within Borrego and ensures the quickest response time.
- We&apos;ve expanded details regarding Cases and Service Visits, so you&apos;ll be able to see real-time updates if your system undergoes repair and will know when to expect us on site for any scheduled Service Visits.
- Lastly, I created an automatic recurring production report that now posts within your documents folder on the portal. Just click the link within the Project Documents tab and click on the &apos;00. Production Reports&apos; folder to access the previous month&apos;s report. These reports will populate on the 1st of the month and will include production data for the preceding month.


Thanks again for your time and for {!Account.Name}&apos;s commitment to solar energy. I look forward to working with you and am here should you need anything moving forward.

Cheers,
Tommy
