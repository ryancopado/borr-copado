Once we’ve received the attached signature pages, you will receive an email for ADP login where you can set up your tax info and benefits. Please note that you must enroll in benefits through ADP within 30 days of your date of hire. Your benefits elections will be effective the first day of the month after start date and will be retroactive if you enroll after  but still within the 30 day window. 

As a member of the Operations team, you are required to complete the OSHA30 certification. If you have already completed this training, please provide HR with your certification or let us know if you need to be registered in the course to obtain your certification. The training link will be sent out from 360training.com and is available on-demand with your unique login. Once started, the training must be completed within six months. Please provide HR with a copy of your certificate of completion for your personnel file. 

We would also like to introduce you to our "Energize Your Peers" program. While we understand it is important for leaders to recognize and reward their staff/team we also believe that it is important to invigorate peer-to-peer recognition. As a new employee, we encourage you to energize a peer within your first few weeks at Borrego who was key to a positive onboarding experience and served as a role model in the categories of Collaborating/Helping/Mentoring during the onboarding process. More information about the program can be found here.
