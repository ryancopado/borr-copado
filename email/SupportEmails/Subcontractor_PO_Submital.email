Hello- 

Please process the attached new Borrego Solar order. If there are any questions or if you need something adjusted, please let me know. Please include this purchase order number on all invoices for accurate processing.

Also, when submitting invoices please include a copy of the correct conditional lien release. If you need a blank copy, please contact Saralyn at the address below.

Once an invoice is generated, please email a copy to our AP Administrator, Saralyn Frieler, at sfrieler@borregosolar.com and send the original invoice to the San Diego Corporate office. 

Thank you,
