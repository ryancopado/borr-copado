Hello- 

Please process the attached new Borrego Solar order. If there are any questions or if you need something adjusted, please let me know.

Also, please send an order confirmation (SOA) with an approximate shipping date to the Project Manager and I so we can plan accordingly. 

Once an invoice is generated, please email a copy via email to our AP Department at apdocs@borregosolar.com and send the original invoice to the San Diego Corporate office.
 
Thank you,
