Borrego Solar Salesforce Users,
    I have been looking through salesforce, and have noticed that there are a few duplicate records. It is not that bad right now, but if we continue to duplicate records things are going to get pretty messy. 
   Please search for entries prior to creates new accounts, contacts, and opportunities. Thank you.
