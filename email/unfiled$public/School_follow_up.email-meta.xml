Dear Mr. Forrster - 

I work with Borrego Solar, a national solar company that provides solar to schools at no cost. We design, install, operate and maintain the solar system at your institution with no up-front cost and no financial risk. You simply purchase clean, renewable solar power from us at a discount to what you currently pay for electricity.

Antioch USD is qualified for the same no money down financing we’ve secured for schools across the Country. Without any capital outlay, your school will be able to go solar, reduce their carbon footprint, be protected from rising energy rates, and save money on day one.  There are no risks, because we pay all of the operations and maintenance costs.

For 30 years, Borrego Solar has been working to help schools go solar.  Some of our recent customers include: 

University of California, San Diego 
College of Marin 
Lagunitas School District 
Marin Country Day School 
Novato Charter School 
Laguna Beach School District 
San Diego Community College District 
New Haven Unified School District 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
Smith College 
Hopkinton School District 
Sierra Community College District 
Peralta Community College District
Projects like these bring jobs to the local community, provide positive public relations, and improve school operating budgets.  When you have a moment, please give me a call as I&apos;d love to learn more about your solar and sustainability goals.  Also, if there is a person on campus who is already thinking about this issue, please forward this email.

Thanks in advance for your time, and I&apos;ll look forward to speaking with you soon.
 
Best regards,
