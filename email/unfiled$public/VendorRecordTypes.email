Borrego Solar Salesforce Users,
    I have created seperate Account record types for Vendors and Customers. When you create accounts from now on you will have to choose either Vendor or Customer. When viewing a vendor account you will not see a lot of the customer specific project management and CEC data that is not applicable to vendors.
   Hopefully this is self explanatory. I will do some training on this when I get back in the office next week.
